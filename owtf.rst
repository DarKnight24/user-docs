Overview
========

The purpose of this tool is to automate the manual, uncreative part of pen testing:
For example, spending time trying to remember how to call "tool X", parsing results
of "tool X" manually to feed "tool Y", etc.

By reducing this burden we hope pen testers will have more time to:

* See the big picture and think out of the box
* More efficiently find, verify and combine vulnerabilities
* Have time to investigate complex vulnerabilities like business logic/architectural flaws or virtual hosting sessions
* Perform more tactical/targeted fuzzing on seemingly risky areas
* Demonstrate true impact despite the short timeframes we are typically given to test.

This tool is however not a silverbullet and will only be as good as the person using it. Understanding and
experience will be required to correctly interpret tool output and decide what to investigate further in
order to demonstrate impact.
