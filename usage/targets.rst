Managing Targets
================

The targets page also known as target manager presents a ton of information. It has three important
features

    * A textarea to add new targets
    * A targets table to go search through targets
    * A session manager to manage sessions
    * A button to launch plugins against targets

    Multiple targets can be added at once

Remove Targets
--------------

To present the information in an orderly fashion, all targets are shown in the form of a table.
The labels beside the target name shows the severity of any vulnerability discovered either by OWTF
or by user (yes, user can have his own rankings)
